## Project Title
Flashcards
## Description
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and completed as part of the Codecademy Front-End Engineer path. Routing was already implemented, as were components; the task was to create three new slices for different parts of the state and use other features of RTK to make the app functional. On the Topics page, users can add topics they would like to study. On the New Quiz page, users can select from their topics and make flashcards to create a quiz. The quizzes can then be seen on the Quizzes page. Clicking on a quiz takes you to the flashcards within that quiz. You can click on the flashcard to swap between sides.
